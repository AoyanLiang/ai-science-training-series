I am currently working on high entropy alloys (HEA), which is a hot topic in materials science. 
This kind of alloys can have up to 5 or more elements and still form a single phase, and has many excellent properties. 
A big challange for HEAs is exporing their compositional spcaces and investigating their microstructures, which is impossible to do that in real experiments because we can have more than 592 billion HEA bases with 3â€“6 principal elements.
So based on what I have learnt in this training session. I think neural network is quiet suitable for this application. 
We can train the network with existing data, the inputs are the element types and their contents, while the outputs are their corresponding microstructures. 
Then we can further use this network to predict the microstrures or even properties for other compositions and guide the experimental work.
